Code injection via unsanitized $_SESSION array, checks in php are just for DOM, not for $_SESSION as a whole
Set admin to 1
Take note of PHPSESSID for experimenter page as it is different than the one for http://natas21.natas.labs.overthewire.org/
Go to http://natas21.natas.labs.overthewire.org/ and change the PHPSESSID on the fly (Burp helps) to the one owned by experimenter page
