What we want:
The password for the next level stored (hopefully) in the row satisfying username=natas28 

What we know:
1) Database gets cleared every 5 min 
2) Fields are described as follows:

CREATE TABLE `users` (
  `username` varchar(64) DEFAULT NULL,
  `password` varchar(64) DEFAULT NULL
);

3) All inputs are sanitized with mysql_real_escape_string() so SQLi is going to be difficult, no brute forcing the creds with LIKE :(
4) The dumpData function will display all (username,password) pairs for a given username. Nice!
5) If a user doesn't exist it will be created with the password provided. Nicer!

Strategy:
Every 5 minutes the db will get cleared, and presumably the admin/natas28 will have to be created by the server for the admin to log back in.
Let's try sending the following request over and over until it hits the time where admin/natas28 has not been created yet.
  http://natas27.natas.labs.overthewire.org/?username=natas28&password=AAAAA
I started with natas28 because of previous challenges.
Success! See natas27.py in this repo for the code.
